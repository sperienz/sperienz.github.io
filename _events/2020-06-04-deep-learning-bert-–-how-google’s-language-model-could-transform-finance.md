BERT reads sentences as ordered sequences rather than simply a jumble of words, allowing it to understand intent and excel at key language understanding tasks - such as classification, question answering, and named entity recognition.

Refinitiv Labs have been using Google's BERT model and adapting it for the nuances of financially focused language.

In this 30-min virtual lab, we will share:

* The principles on which BERT operates Practical advice on using BERT based on our experience
* A practical application of BERT to document classification, identifying ESG controversies in news stories
