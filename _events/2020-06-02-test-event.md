Rapid urbanisation, increasing air pollution, and changes in behaviour are particularly pressing challenges in urban environments today. How can technology, innovation and intelligent design help cities to build public transport systems that are sustainable, resilient and centred around humans?

While assessing the impact of COVID-19 on public transport systems, we are already seeing exciting innovations that are changing the face of the sector. With this webinar, we aim to explore how long-term needs and recent disruptions will shape the evolution and development of public transportation systems. On 15 June, in partnership with SGInnovate, we will discuss the adoption of new transport modalities, and how innovation ecosystems are transforming mobility with innovative practices, technologies and novel business models.
