Chong Guan  abd Calvin M L Chan:

COVID-19 has revealed the potential – and the limits – of Singapore’s online shopping sector. If anything, this crisis underscores how adaptive human beings are. Individuals and businesses alike are embracing digital transformation and adopting innovative approaches in response to a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous situation.

ONLINE GROCERY SHOPPING

The outlook for Singapore’s retail industry was bleak even before the coronavirus crisis went into high gear. Singapore's retail sales dropped by 5.3 per cent year-on-year in January 2020, the 12th straight month of fall.  But Singapore’s grocery market  is expected to be worth S$9.9 billion by 2023, up 14.5 per cent from 2018, according to research firm IGD Asia. Online grocery shopping is the fastest-growing slice of the pie, with Alibaba-backed RedMart dominating the scene and NTUC FairPrice continuing to invest in online platforms. Many traditional small wet market grocers have also taken to online channels to hawk products, conduct online auctions and even to carry out customer relation-building.

COVID-19 may accelerate the growth of Singapore’s online grocery sector. RedMart’s weekly average number of orders tripled, while FairPrice said that demand for online orders exceeded that during the Lunar New Year period.  After authorities encouraged Singaporeans to purchase food and groceries online, Amazon Prime, FairPrice and Redmart have been swamped with orders, preventing them from providing enough delivery slots for online purchases.

OVERCOMING CAPACITY LIMITS

The current inability to fulfil delivery of online purchases suggests digitalisation effort by these businesses have only been focused at the customer-facing end.  Resourceful and more ambitious businesses should also look to leveraging digital technologies to transform their business and enhance supply chains to meet surges in demand.

One suggestion is for supermarket chains to integrate their online shopping platforms with the stock-holding information of their physical branches to avoid loss-of-sale scenarios and offer customers the option of picking up their purchases at physical branches, especially during times of insufficient delivery slots. Another possibility is for online shopping platforms to partner with businesses that specialise in delivery fulfilment such as Deliveroo, GoGoVan, Grab and Ninja Van. Already, the Government has allowed taxi and private-hire car drivers to make grocery and food deliveries, given how these drivers are struggling with reduced passenger demand.

LUXURY GOODS

The coronavirus has cast a bigger shadow over luxury and durable goods, like clothing and furniture, compared to daily necessities. A recent study by Italian trade association for luxury brands Altagamma, in association with Boston Consulting Group, predicted that the global luxury sales could scale down by US$33 to US$44 billion.

Despite the difficulties, leading luxury groups have responded quickly to the crisis through innovative cause marketing approaches and digitalisation.  These moves not only address societal needs and expectations in the near-term, but will also contribute to their brand development in the long-term. 

WILL THE NEW NORMAL PERSIST?

A recent survey by Kantar in China revealed that 65 per cent of consumers were looking forward to eating out with friends and family most after lockdown, with shopping a close second at 58 per cent. But it will be difficult to close Pandora’s Box once it has been opened. Even when most consumers may return to old habits, those who have found value and satisfaction with their online experience may persist with their online consumption. 

There is also a good chance for the emergence of a “newer normal” where consumption habits become dualistic, where consumers continue to buy online even as they return to their old habits of tactile consumption. The choice between the two will likely be down to which can offer better value. For example, a consumer may decide to visit a physical store after viewing a product promotion over a livestreaming session on social media. After trying out the product at the physical store, he may then compare prices and product reviews online before making an online purchase and having the product delivered to his home. Business that have undergone digital transformation can have the capability to collect data along the consumer decision journey, strategically design their online content and offline experience to optimise the customer’s value across various touchpoints. 

PREPARING FOR A NEWER NORMAL

Understandably, it can be tempting for businesses to go into cost containment mode given the gloomy economic outlook.  However, there is now a unique opportunity for businesses to draw on schemes to embark on digital transformation and adopt innovative approaches. The Unity Budget will not only help businesses tide through an economic downturn triggered by COVID-19, but will also prepare them to be more agile in facing an increasingly digital world.
