Cai Daolu:

To say that the current state of the global economy is tumultuous is an understatement.  The biggest economy in the world, the US suffered a massive contraction of 4.8 per cent for the first quarter of 2020. In a matter of weeks, it experienced both the lowest and the highest unemployment rate in the past 50 years.

FAMILIES ARE TIGHTENING BELTS 

Households are not only incredibly cautious with their new habits of personal hygiene, but also extra careful with their spending. Overall consumer spending in the US, which contributes over two-thirds of GDP, declined over 7 per cent last month. Consumer spending on durable goods, items like vehicles, furniture and appliances, dropped by almost 15 per cent, twice as much as the fall observed during the global financial crisis of 2008. Recovery to previous peak levels took almost three years.

HEALTH CONCERNS HOLD PEOPLE BACK FROM SPENDING

Back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the fear of getting infected is the contributing factor in accounting for the reduction in consumer spending, rather than the implementation of movement restrictions. Fear hurts more the economy than the lockdown measures. Easing restrictions prematurely may not be an effective policy to reactivate the economy – people simply will not spend if they are afraid of subsequent waves of contagion.  The sooner we are able to contain the spread of the virus, locally and globally, the faster we will see a rebound in the economy. While stay-in measures are costly to the economy, they are not as costly as policy inaction or the inability to control the spread of the virus, which tackle fears people have of coming out.

EVEN PARTIAL RECOVERY WILL BE CHALLENGING

For the economy to get its engines revving again, consumers need to be confident there is strong containment of the virus and families feel safe returning to work.  Even a partial rebound depends crucially upon effective public health containment policies – especially having in place a mass testing and contact tracing capability. Most unemployment numbers observed in the US in this current crisis is temporary and not permanent, meaning these unemployed workers expect a recall from their firms to be reemployed upon reopening, a vast difference from the global financial crisis. As long as companies continue to keep workers on the payroll during this difficult time, the chances of a speedy recovery will be higher.

HOPES FOR A FULL RECOVERY 

Any prediction on the economic outcome of this pandemic is premature at this stage given the magnitude of the uncertainty we face and the historical infrequency of pandemics. Yet, countries have a chance to restore consumer confidence and the economy if they prioritise managing the health risks.There will be inevitable sectoral and structural changes as a consequence of this pandemic. Businesses in tourism, entertainment and recreation industries will have to adapt to survive.
