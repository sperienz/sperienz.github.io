Joyce Lim:

The surge in demand due to the circuit breaker has prompted an influx of new delivery platforms. While it has led to more choices and lower fees, there are also challenges, such as a lack of riders and patchy service quality.

Beyond the Big Three players - Foodpanda, Deliveroo and GrabFood which entered the market in 2012, 2015 and 2018 respectively - at least 10 new platforms have leapt onto the food-delivery bandwagon.

* WhyQ partnered FairPrice Group and started Marketplace@WhyQ to deliver food from foodcourts, coffee shops and restaurants.
* Pickupp Singapore went into on-demand food delivery in March.
* CapitaLand launched Capita3Eats, which delivers food from eateries in its malls.
* Reservation platform Chope started offering delivery options from April 9.
* Buy4u was launched the week that the circuit breaker kicked in on April 7. 
* Tech firms Oddle and Butleric will be launching Oddle Eats and B28 respectively.
* Deliver.sg, which has 140 restaurants on its platform engages Lalamove to make deliveries.

Even as the economy gradually opens up, with eateries possibly reopening for dining before the end of this month, some are clearly betting that the habit of ordering food online and having it delivered to one's doorstep is here to stay.

According to research firm Statista, Singapore's revenue in the online food delivery segment is expected to amount to US$464 million (S$647 million) this year.  With the increased competition, hungry consumers have far more choices and, in some cases, are paying less for their food deliveries. But challenges also abound, from a limited pool of riders to food safety concerns.  OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: "Some competition is always good, if it drives down costs for consumers and the margin being extracted from hawkers and restaurants. But if it comes at a price of delays or order cancellations, then the quality of service suffers.  "This may be the period of adjustment and the market will try to find an equilibrium over time."

DELIVERY RIDERS 

Among these start-ups, many do not have their own riders or drivers. By contrast, GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo have their own teams of riders, numbering 10,000 for Foodpanda and 7,000 for Deliveroo. The new platforms tend to use third-party transport firms, such as Lalamove and taxi and private-hire companies, to carry out the deliveries.

A Foodpanda rider earns an average of $7.50 a delivery. A GrabFood rider makes between $5.50 and $12 per delivery. Those with cars earn slightly more, from $7 to $16.  With many platforms tapping the same pool of delivery riders, it is inevitable that some deliveries are delayed or even cancelled during peak periods and special occasions.  

Deliver.sg don't have their fleet of riders and choose to to wait and see given the challenge to manage logistics. Whenever a food order is placed on Deliver.sg, the restaurant owner and Lalamove will be notified simultaneously. Usually, the restaurant has about 20 minutes to prepare the food, while Lalamove will assign a driver to pick it up.

WhyQ which was launched in 2017, delivers about 3,000 meals daily now and has since tripled its pool of workers to 200 delivery riders and 100 hawker captains.  Its staff - known as "hawker captains" - head to various food centres to collect orders from different stalls and bring the food to a distribution point at each food centre where delivery riders will pick them up. During the circuit breaker period, WhyQ engaged third-party delivery services from Lalamove and Zeek to fulfil orders.

Pickupp Singapore, which started out making islandwide deliveries for bakeries, florists and frozen-food sellers using its fleet of three vans, has been engaging freelancers.  It now has a database of 11,000 active delivery men and women to do food-related deliveries, which range between 100 and 3,000 a day.

FOOD SAFETY

One question that has arisen is whether these new players have the resources to ensure that food is transported safely. At Foodpanda, food must be delivered within the hour. Riders are trained on food handling and hygiene practices and encouraged to clean and air their food storage bags thoroughly after each shift.  "Every three months, riders will need to report to our hubs for quality checks and to ensure that their equipment remains sanitary. They are also strictly reminded to never handle unpackaged food," said a spokesman.

Some of the newer platforms do not provide any thermal bags to riders now, but plan to do so in the near future.  They also tend to have a longer delivery time frame - up to two hours. It is for this reason that some restaurants eschew the platforms and choose to carry out deliveries themselves.

LOWER FEES 

With the influx of players, some have been slashing commissions to attract more eateries to list on their platforms.  This has been a big plus for eateries which have long complained about the Big Three taking a hefty cut - up to 35 per cent - of their earnings. In April, about 8,000 restaurant owners and customers signed a petition protesting against their high commission fees.

Deliver.sg takes no commission. Instead, it raises food prices by about 10 per cent, and pockets the extra.  Their delivery fee ranges from $10 to $20. Marketplace@WhyQ does not charge its vendors any commission or set-up fee either. Instead, it marks up food prices by 6 per cent. Meanwhile WhyQ's hawker platform revenue is derived from a combination of a delivery fee of $1.50 per meal paid by the customer, as well as a cut of the takings from hawkers.  If hawkers cannot pay a commission, WhyQ would then mark up their food prices, which are paid by the customers.

WILL THEY SURVIVE COVID-19? 

Mr Hau Koh Foo, director of Singapore Management University Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, thinks not. Paying for food to be delivered to homes is unaffordable for many people, he noted, referring to the high delivery costs. "If prices can't go down, only the big players will survive because they can use this business to augment their other businesses." Hoping to circumvent this, new players like Butleric intends to provide another service to eateries: analysing customer data and helping them grow their business.
