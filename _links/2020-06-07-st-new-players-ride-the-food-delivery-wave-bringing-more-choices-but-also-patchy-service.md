Joyce Lim:

The surge in demand due to the circuit breaker has prompted an influx of new delivery platforms. While it has led to more choices and lower fees, there are also challenges, such as a lack of riders and patchy service quality.

Beyond the Big Three players - Foodpanda, Deliveroo and GrabFood which entered the market in 2012, 2015 and 2018 respectively - at least 10 new platforms have leapt onto the food-delivery bandwagon.

- WhyQ partnered FairPrice Group and started Marketplace@WhyQ to deliver food from foodcourts, coffee shops and restaurants. 
- Pickupp Singapore went into on-demand food delivery in March. 
- CapitaLand launched Capita3Eats, which delivers food from eateries in its malls. 
- Reservation platform Chope started offering delivery options from April 9. 
- Buy4u was launched the week that the circuit breaker kicked in on April 7. 
- Tech firms Oddle and Butleric will be launching Oddle Eats and B28 respectively.
- Deliver.sg, which has 140 restaurants on its platform engages Lalamove to make deliveries.

Even as the economy gradually opens up, with eateries possibly reopening for dining before the end of this month, some are clearly betting that the habit of ordering food online and having it delivered to one's doorstep is here to stay.

According to research firm Statista, Singapore's revenue in the online food delivery segment is expected to amount to US$464 million (S$647 million) this year. With the increased competition, hungry consumers have far more choices and, in some cases, are paying less for their food deliveries. But challenges also abound, from a limited pool of riders to food safety concerns. OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: "Some competition is always good, if it drives down costs for consumers and the margin being extracted from hawkers and restaurants. But if it comes at a price of delays or order cancellations, then the quality of service suffers. "This may be the period of adjustment and the market will try to find an equilibrium over time."

FIGHT FOR RIDERS
Among these start-ups, many do not have their own riders or drivers. By contrast, GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo have their own teams of riders, numbering 10,000 for Foodpanda and 7,000 for Deliveroo. The new platforms tend to use third-party transport firms, such as Lalamove and taxi and private-hire companies, to carry out the deliveries.

A Foodpanda rider earns an average of $7.50 a delivery. A GrabFood rider makes between $5.50 and $12 per delivery. Those with cars earn slightly more, from $7 to $16. With many platforms tapping the same pool of delivery riders, it is inevitable that some deliveries are delayed or even cancelled during peak periods and special occasions. 

Deliver.sg don't have their fleet of riders and choose to to wait and see given the challenge to manage logistics. Whenever a food order is placed on Deliver.sg, the restaurant owner and Lalamove will be notified simultaneously. Usually, the restaurant has about 20 minutes to prepare the food, while Lalamove will assign a driver to pick it up.

For WhyQ, its staff - known as "hawker captains" - head to various food centres to collect orders from different stalls and bring the food to a distribution point at each food centre where delivery riders will pick them up.

WhyQ which was launched in 2017, delivers about 3,000 meals daily now and has since tripled its pool of workers to 200 delivery riders and 100 hawker captains. It engages contract workers who carry out services only for WhyQ during their shift.
