Nitin Pangarkar:

The spread of the coronavirus has had a tremendous impact on the travel industry.  Major airports like Singapore and Dubai have seen passenger volumes plummet. Airports continue to incur fixed costs for maintaining the infrastructure. Their burden is even greater because partners such as retail outlets and airlines have been given breaks in terms of rentals and reduced parking and other fees, respectively.

We should anticipate that, going forward, the future will be very challenging for airport hubs like Singapore and Dubai. There is a distinct possibility passenger volumes may never return to pre COVID-19 levels. Even the financially strong Changi Airport (with share capital and reserves at S$3.54 billion and retained profits of S$4.29 billion in the last financial year) is treading carefully.

The huge uncertainty has shaken projections of the prospects for air travel. In March, based on a scenario of extensive spread of the virus, IATA projected a 19 per cent loss in revenues for airlines in 2020, equating to US$113 billion. They revised that estimate to US$314 billion barely a few weeks later.

LEISURE TRAVEL: WORSE THAN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 

A unique aspect of this coronavirus crisis is that it is primarily a public health crisis, which will leave psychological scars on the health risks of traveling and potentially catching the virus. Even if the mortality rates turn out to be low in the long run, public perceptions about the health hazards of COVID-19 may not change quickly or easily. 

Although cooped-up-at-home leisure travelers are keener than ever to go explore the world, they are unlikely do so if it jeopardises their health, not to mention if traveling involves them being quarantined for weeks once they’ve touched down at their destination.  There are also two additional factors at work: First, although youths travel the most out of any given demographic, the elderly form a sizable proportion of leisure travelers who take longer vacations. If the elderly stay away from leisure travel, this will affect overall leisure travel demand tremendously.  Second, regulatory policies for travel post COVID-19 are not yet clear. Post COVID-19, airlines may be forced to keep middle seats empty for social distancing which is likely to lead to higher prices thus dampen demand for air travel.

BUSINESS TRAVEL ISN’T LOOKING GOOD EITHER 

In the post COVID-19 world, businesses are likely to be cost conscious because of challenged profitability. Business travel is a discretionary expense that can be easily cut when businesses are looking to save costs. During the lockdowns imposed in many countries, many businesses and employees would have probably realised that though technological solutions such as video conferencing cannot fully replace the face-to face interaction facilitated by air travel, they impose lower cash costs and inconveniences.  Thus, a significant part of the demand for business travel will permanently shift to video conferencing. Finally, the threat of jeopardising one’s health and the eventual cost-benefit analysis for many business travelers will likely suggest less air travel.

AIRPORTS HAVE IT ROUGH 

Because of their high fixed costs, even a 10 per cent decline in demand will inflict a lot of pain on businesses such as airlines and airport operations. Air hubs like Singapore, which depend on transit traffic are even more vulnerable. If travelers are concerned about catching infections at the airport, they will exhibit a strong preference for direct flights compared to those involving a transit, thus affecting passenger volumes at hubs like Singapore or Dubai. 

Compared to airports, airlines might have a few more degrees of freedom to deal with the challenges in the post COVID-19 environment. Some airlines are already going out of business (thus reducing alternatives and competition), the survivors might code-share (thus reducing costs and supply) and airlines might find new ways to charge customers for conveniences that have been taken for granted in the past (for instance, inflight entertainment).
