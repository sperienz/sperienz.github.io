Susan Froetschel and Douglas P Olsen:

As countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas take steps to restart economies, public health departments rely on contact tracing to identify and isolate cases, and prevent new waves of infections. “It is estimated that each infected person can, on average, infect two to three others,” notes the National Plan to Enable Comprehensive COVID-19 Case Finding and Contact Tracing in the US, from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. “This means that if 1 person spreads the virus to 3 others, that first positive case can turn into more than 59,000 cases in 10 rounds of infections.”

MANUAL CONTACT TRACING THE GOLD STANDARD
“Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission,” notes the World Health Organization. “When systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission of an infectious disease and is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying persons who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and following them up daily for 14 days from the last point of exposure.”

Initially, public health officials hoped that tracking smartphones and digital contact tracing apps might help in spotting and containing outbreaks. Companies introduced an array of applications, to be used on a voluntary basis. In addition to privacy concerns, researchers warn about false-positive and or false-negative notifications, as well as the need for an 80 per cent participation rate from phone users for such applications to be effective. Manual contact tracing with interviews remains the gold standard, and the World Health Organization credited the early and extensive use of contact tracing measures in Germany and South Korea for stopping virus clusters before they went out of control. 

APPROACH TO CONTACT TRACING
Safely reopening workplaces requires extensive testing, contact tracing and tremendous cooperation from individuals – with diligence on distancing and pro-active self-discipline on quarantines among those who suspect exposure.

To contain the virus quickly, WHO urges member states to recruit and train contact tracing teams early when there is no or low transmissions. Contact tracers should emphasise positive contributions for communities and resist presenting the questions or quarantine recommendations as punishment. “Communication about contact tracing should emphasise solidarity, reciprocity, and the common good,” the WHO document on contact tracing notes. 
“By participating in contact tracing, communities will contribute to controlling local spread of COVID-19, vulnerable people will be protected, and more restrictive measures, such as general stay-at-home orders, might be avoided or minimised.”
