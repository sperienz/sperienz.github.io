Unmanned stores have been around for several years, but there are too few of them. NTUC FairPrice launched its first unmanned, cashless Cheers convenience store at Nanyang Polytechnic in 2017. With convenience stores leading the way in adopting unmanned shops, planners see scope for a similar format to be adopted by the wider retail sector. 

At the Singapore Retail Industry Conference and Exhibition on Friday (Aug 16), three home-grown retailers showcased new concepts that use technology, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID), cashless payments and artificial intelligence (AI), to allow shoppers to enter stores and buy items without having to interact with a salesperson. The companies - Pick & Go, Octobox and OMO Store - developed their innovative ideas with support from government agency Enterprise Singapore. These innovations are part of ongoing efforts by the sector to hold its own against growing competition from online retailers and to cope with difficulties in hiring workers.

At Octobox's unmanned store, for example, customers scan their palms to get inside. When they have chosen their items, they go into a check-out room which automatically detects the RFID tags on their purchases. To pay, customers scan their palms again so that they can use their DBS PayLah wallet, keying in the last four digits of their mobile number for authentication.

Mr Alan Yeo, director at Enterprise Singapore's retail and design division, said unmanned stores deliver a fresh and interesting experience for customers while boosting productivity by reducing the manpower traditionally needed to run the stores. He said: "While convenience store operators are leading the adoption of the unmanned store format, we see potential for such retail formats to be successfully adopted by retailers."
