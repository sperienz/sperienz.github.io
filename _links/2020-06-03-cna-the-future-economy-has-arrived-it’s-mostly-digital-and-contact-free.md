Nick Lambert:

Considering the theory of punctuated equilibrium, COVID-19 is our next huge disruption that we have to manage. Among the various possible scenarios, one thing is certain: New trends will emerge. 

There is a high likelihood that APAC will morph into being what will effectively be a contact-free economy. Online shopping was already proving increasingly popular with consumers in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) before COVID-19, but lockdowns and stringent restrictions have sent it through the roof. 

E-commerce in APAC was forecast to be worth US$3.5 trillion by 2021, according to the eMarketer 2019 Global E-commerce Forecast. While the emergence of the contact-free economy is likely to see this number revised upwards, APAC ecommerce platforms like Lazada, Shopee, ShopBack and Zalora are helping brands and consumers during COVID-19. According to research by Ipsos, Vietnam has seen 57 per cent of shoppers shifting their purchasing online, with India at 57 per cent and China at 50 per cent not far behind. Data will be central to all the advances we make in e-health and e-commerce, as companies use customer experience and feedback to build insights that help make offerings better and relationships with end-users stronger.

Enterprises will need to focus more than ever on building new customer relationships through effective digital experiences, since physical interaction with them will be far less. With so many end-users and customers quarantined in their homes, these digital experiences will matter more than ever. Companies must be robust. Those that will thrive will be those able to retain customer trust during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently lead those customers out of it.
