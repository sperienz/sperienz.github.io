Amy Dawel, Eryn Newman, Sonia McCallum:

We surveyed a representative sample of Australian adults at the end of March, about a week after restaurants and cafes first closed, and with gatherings restricted to two people.

Even at this early stage, it was clear levels of depression and anxiety were much higher than usual in the community.   Our findings show adverse events can affect mental health and well-being in unanticipated and mixed ways.

People who experienced psychological conditions before the pandemic may be able to draw on skills they’ve learned through therapy to help them re-engage. But people without any prior experience of anxiety or depression could struggle more because they have never had to manage these conditions before.

One effective psychological approach to managing anxiety is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  CBT involves learning about how your thoughts affect your mood, and developing strategies to manage problematic thinking patterns. Importantly, CBT can be effectively delivered online. Mindfulness, regular exercise and getting enough sleep can also help manage anxiety.

There’s much speculation on what the future will look like, resulting in the “new normal” terminology. A key concern as we continue to navigate this new normal is our collective mental health. No model can perfectly predict the complex impacts of this unprecedented pandemic.  We’ll need ongoing data collection to assess how community mental health is faring over the coming months. And we’ll need to use this data to implement evidence-based mental health strategies and policies as and when they’re needed.
