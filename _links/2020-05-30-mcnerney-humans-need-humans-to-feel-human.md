Matthew McNerney:

The plain truth is that humans need humans to feel human. Technology amid this pandemic is not a panacea — it’s triage. Used correctly, technology is a powerful tool that can amplify the best of humanity: community, intelligence, and even empathy. 

Technology and data unlock human progress in ways in which we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. But being fueled by digital and an experience “feeling” digital are two radically different paradigms. As a species, we’ll gravitate towards real connection every time. 

The question becomes, “What does *physical* look like in a post-COVID-19 world?”

There are three core opportunities for physical experiences: Satellite spaces (businesses and institutions will need to bring their show on the road), Appointments (strict access protocols, buffering times), and Access Auctions (premium access to experience). Underpinning all of these experiences will be innovative customer service.

Generosity is your new currency, and flexibility is now standard practice. Connecting all of these initiatives must be a renewed commitment to customer service. We’ll need to meet people where they are, both physically and emotionally.
