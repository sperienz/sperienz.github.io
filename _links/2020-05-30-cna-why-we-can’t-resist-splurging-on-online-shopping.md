The demand for online shopping has obviously increased since COVID-19 restrictions were put in place. In the last week of April, more than two million parcels a day were delivered across the Australia Post network. This is 90 per cent more than the same time last year. More recently, data based on a weekly sample - from May 11 to May 17 - of transactions revealed food delivery increased by 230 per cent, furniture and office goods purchases rose 140 per cent and alcohol and tobacco sales rose 45 per cent.

Beyond the fact most people are spending more time at home, there are a range of psychological factors behind the online shopping upheaval. Shopping can be a way to cope with stress. In fact, higher levels of distress have been linked with higher purchase intentions. And this compulsion to buy is often part of an effort to reduce negative emotions. In other words, shopping is an escape.

The act of shopping alone produces increased arousal, heightened involvement, perceived freedom, and fantasy fulfilment. It seems the stress and boredom brought on by this pandemic has intensified our will to spend.
