The retail industry has already been suffering for a few years now. According to data by the Department of Statistics, retail sales value has been decreasing since 2018, which was when it dropped for the first time in nine years by 0.19%. This figure is $3.1 billion in February, a drop of 8.6% y-o-y. The URA’s latest figures show that retail vacancy rates have inched upwards from 7.5% in 4Q2019 to 8.0% in 1Q2020. Across the board, consultants believe that more tenants will be giving up space than signing new leases in 2Q2020.

Meanwhile, Online retailer Lazada is seeing strong growth in different areas. A Lazada spokesperson says: “We have seen a corresponding increase in the number of weekly orders and customers during this period. People are buying more products that support a stay-at-home lifestyle, such as home entertainment, fitness equipment, games and not to forget groceries.”

Consultants believe that e-commerce will become commonplace and retail real estate will have to reinvent themselves to stay relevant. Teh Seng Leong, global real estate, hospitality and construction M&A leader at EY, says: “Despite high online penetration, the proportion of online retail sales to overall retail sales at 5% to 7% is still quite little compared to China, where the figure is actually 30% to 40%. There is much more room to grow.” He adds: “In the post-Covid-19 world, there needs to be more reinventing as consumer behaviour is changing. Fundamental assumptions such as: ‘We have a great space, tenants have no choice but to rent from us’ will have to change.”

Desmond Sim, head of research at CBRE, believes that people shop online for cheaper prices but some might find the gratification too slow. “Buying something online is not the same as walking into a shop, getting an item and using it right away,” he explains. “Our city is quite dense too, so a supermarket or a shopping mall is never too far away. I think it is unlikely that online shopping will overtake brick-and-mortar shops unless we are able to improve our last-mile delivery industry to shorten waiting time significantly.”

Two trends have emerged in recent years in the brick-and-mortar retail industry recently are experiential shopping and omni-channel retailing. These strategies play up on what e-commerce cannot provide. A third trend that could emerge is incorporation of automation and artificial intelligence. 

“...some malls and shops already offer ‘click-and-collect’. Basically, you do not have to shop physically and jostle with crowds. You can choose your item online, but drive to a drive-through or a carpark to collect it, so the speed of gratification is there. This is great for safe distancing too.”
