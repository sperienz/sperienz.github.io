Chew Hui Min:

When travelling becomes feasible again after COVID-19 dies down, the experience is unlikely to be the same. The global tourism industry, which has been one of the worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, will go through a fundamental shift, said experts.

“The industry will never be the same again: The industry will have to adapt and respond to the new normal and people working in this industry will likewise will have to adapt and change,” said Mr Michael Chiam, senior lecturer in tourism at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

Operators of hotels and attractions in Singapore see a few emerging trends - hygiene would be top of the mind for travellers; an aversion to crowds means a change in how many leisure activities will be conducted; and technology will play a significant part in this transformation.

Marina Bay Sands (MBS) told that the guest experience when it reopens will be “quite different”.  “Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have explored ways to boost our business resiliency and enhance public health,” said a spokesperson. “Some 40 task forces have been set up during this period to explore how to improve operations in the post-COVID world, from reimagining our processes and venue set-ups to designing masks and goggles that seek to protect both staff and guests.”

It is not the only hospitality business that is rethinking its processes.

DISINFECT, SANITISE, STERILISE

Hotels CNA spoke to said that hygiene and sanitation will be stepped up, and items like masks, hand sanitisers and disinfecting wipes will become part of the amenity kits given to guests upon check-in.  Hygiene protocols and safe distancing rules will be part of the briefing moving forward. Hotels such as MBS and Marriot International said that key cards will be sanitised before they are reused, and hospital-grade disinfectants will be used for cleaning. “We see safety and hygiene as ‘the new amenity’ when booking hotels, and we are taking this very seriously,” said Mr Rajeev Menon, president of Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China) at Marriott International.

For Banyan Tree, a SafeSanctuary programme is being rolled out from June to all its properties. This includes a reboot of protocols in more than 40 areas, from protective gear to sanitisation and disinfecting protocols, as well as safe distancing.  There will be hourly cleaning of high-touch areas around its resorts, and bed linen will be steamed when they are changed. The role of their hygiene managers will be expanded to implement and reinforce these new measures.

Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, president of the Singapore Hotel’s Association, agreed that rapid technology adoption will take place to minimise physical contact and raise hygiene standards.  “Hotels will start to introduce electrostatic sprays to deep-sanitise surfaces, for example in hotel rooms as well as public areas, as well as the use of ultraviolet light technology for sanitising guestroom keys and devices shared by employees,” said Ms Kwee.

“Other technology adoptions include thermal scanners and contact-tracing bracelets. There will also be an increase in adoption of contactless technology such as check-ins and check-outs via mobile devices,” said Mr Arthur Kiong, CEO of Far East Hospitality.

Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said: “These measures must be in place to give consumers the confidence and assurance to visit Singapore when travel restrictions are gradually lifted.” “Health and safety will become the top priority of travellers, at least in the short- and mid-term,” said Dr Wong Kin Yin, lecturer at the Nanyang Business School.  He added that digital and automated technologies will be more widely deployed to reduce human-to-human contact.

ZOOM-BA?

In this age of social distancing, fitness classes, cooking sessions and other activities may be conducted privately in your hotel room, or on video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom. Alternatively, access to common facilities will be capped to avoid overcrowding.  For example, MBS will be limiting capacity at its Infinity Pool and staggering check-in and check-out timings to prevent crowds gathering, it said.

Instead of a “personal touch”, guests will be getting touch screens and hotel staff will have to get used to imposing some of these new rules to keep people apart as a safety measure against COVID-19.  Self-check-in kiosks at airports and hotels, contactless payment and virtual tours of attractions will become more prevalent, said Dr Wong. Check-in forms, restaurant menus and attraction tickets can all be digitalised. When dining, for example, guests may call up the menu on their own devices by scanning a QR code, said Banyan Tree. MBS is looking at smart control of lights and appliances in its rooms, it said.

Furama Singapore said it intends to start an unmanned retail stop at hotel lobbies to reduce the interaction between staff members and guests. This is on top of measures such as QR-code ordering, online payments and other tech solutions to clean their hotels.  “The industry must be ready to embrace new digital solutions. The big question is how to incorporate the human touch into technology."

STAYCATIONS, BUSINESS TRAVEL

The tourist demand for hotels in Singapore remains at zero for now, but experts said business travel and domestic tourism will be the first to pick up as virus outbreak gets under control. 

Last week, authorities said that Singapore is in talks with various countries to implement “green lanes” for essential travel, catering to businesses that require their employees to make trips.  Mr Chew Kian Beng, an expert in hospitality and tourism management from Temasek Polytechnic, said that business travellers in this first wave of travel could present an opportunity for Singapore. “With social distancing and additional hygiene measures, travellers will need to pay a premium for tourism services, which can be absorbed as company expense. Also, business travellers would not quibble over flying in earlier to observe the quarantine period before their event,” he said. “Being renowned as a clean city, Singapore would be in a good position to market hygiene-certified tourism services and long-stay lodging packages.”

PREPARING FOR DOMESTIC TOURISM

While STB initially anticipated a 25 to 30 per cent decline in international arrivals this year, in the first three months of 2020, the drop in arrivals was much higher at 43 per cent.  “With travel restrictions remaining in place in Singapore and around the world, we expect the visitor arrivals to decline further,” said STB chief executive Keith Tan.

STB told CNA that when there are signs of improvement, the agency will encourage Singaporeans to support the local tourism industry, which employed around 65,000 workers in 2019.  Singapore attractions are preparing for this. Jewel at Changi Airport said that it will focus its marketing efforts on Singapore residents, given travel restrictions on foreign visitors. Garden by the Bay is exploring the development of an app for visitors to buy time-stamped tickets to indoor attractions and get real-time updates on crowds at the gardens.
