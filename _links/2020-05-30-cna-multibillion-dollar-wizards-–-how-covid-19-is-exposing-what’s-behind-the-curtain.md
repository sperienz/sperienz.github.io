The coronavirus pandemic has taken every imaginable business by surprise. Platform giants should be thriving where the coronavirus have pushed consumers and merchants to embrace e-commerce, yet many are laying off staff. 

For a long time, the main business problem facing many high-profile start-ups had been how to grow quickly and snuff out rivals. The abundance of cheap venture capital injections fuelled price wars aimed at acquiring consumers and undercutting rivals. While food delivery apps in Singapore have come under heavy criticism for charging eateries and hawker food stalls high commission rates during this circuit breaker, the reality was that these fees could barely cover how much deliverers, the scarce resource in this competition among platforms, were compensated. Now, when demand is brimming but almost every delivery can be loss-making, that focus has been their Achilles heel. UberEats has seen a 50 per cent jump in sales this first quarter, yet made even greater losses of US$313 million.

This dynamic between cash-rich venture capitalists and start-ups has been an unhealthy one from the outset, and a market correction is long overdue. Those days of being cash flushed, of having a free hand to hire the best talent and raise more money from other investors to drive up valuations, are over. The bigger question is whether these firms can retool their businesses quickly enough to avoid a bubble bust.

Perhaps part of the reason these firms have come under tremendous pressure is because COVID-19 has exposed many for being services companies with a long logistical train, instead of the tech firms they were masquerading as, which can expand quickly without huge costs, because of intellectual property, software and hardware owned.

The blowback will be on workers who have bought into these firms for so long, pouring in endless hours of work, hoping for a huge payoff once they go public. Many are contract staff or gig workers that do not enjoy employment protections. That reckoning is at hand.
