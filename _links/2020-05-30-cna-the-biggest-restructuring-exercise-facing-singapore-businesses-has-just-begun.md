Lawrence Loh:

Businesses already grappling with a collapse in demand must now shift gears.  The Government’s three-phase approach to reach a “new normal” announced this week signaled a vastly different outlook for the foreseeable future. Physical interaction has traditionally underpinned economic activity, but that assumption has all but vanished with safe physical distancing needed among customers and employees... New ways of doing business and fresh revenue sources must be sought. Leaders in three high-profile human-centric Singapore sectors – retail, food and beverages, and fitness – show how business models must change to find winning formulas.

RETAIL: FOCUS ON THE SERVICES, LESS THE GOODS

Even before circuit breakers kicked in, the retail sector in Singapore was already seeing declines in shop occupancy rates. Vacancies rose to 8 per cent in the first quarter, up from 7.5 per cent in the previous quarter.  In March, Singapore’s retail sales suffered the biggest plunge in 22 years, with key items like clothes and footwear taking the most severe hit.

Yet, today, some bright spots have emerged. Mothercare has bucked the trend in Singapore. Beyond having a website, Mothercare Singapore has a digital nursery advisory that provides expert help on various aspects of being motherhood and the relevant range of products that aid that journey. Customers can book an appointment online and ask about coaching, consultation and perks.  Notably, the average shopping basket size of those using the advisory service is thrice that of a regular online order. If anything, the innovative online retail experience alleviates one of the greatest headaches of shopping: Decision-making. More fundamentally, in moving into services with the nursery advisor idea, Mothercare is changing the idea of what is expected of a retailer.

EATING: FIND YOUR FANBASE, CREATE A RALLY POINT

Dining-in and safe distancing are not natural companions. F&B outlets probably face the greatest challenge as the economy restarts and take a prolonged hit. Even in March, before circuit breaker measures kicked in, F&B sales plunged 23.7 per cent year-on-year. Chope reported that 42 per cent of restaurants would not survive beyond two months and 81 per cent will not last beyond six.

Where many refuse to go quietly into the night, some are banking on a strategy of engaging their most ardent supporters. Mr Melvin Chew started a Facebook group to promote fellow hawkers online. Called the Hawkers United – Dabao 2020, this platform currently has 265,000 members comprising hawkers, customers and delivery providers.  This simple hawker alliance is a win-win. It cuts through delivery apps’ high commission rates as hawkers can connect directly to the customers. More than a “super app”, it is a fantastic idea for hawker fans wanting something different every now and then, where recommendations posted each day push new options so customers do not have to search.

The big take-away is this: Know your fan base and create a rally point for them. This one-stop concept for organising and pooling is a winning formula – involving restructuring at the product distribution level.

FITNESS: CREATE COMPELLING CONTENT, BUILD A COMMUNITY

During the circuit breaker period, fitness providers, gyms and studios, can no longer provide physical sessions or locations for exercise.  The fitness sector has been forced to adopt a new business function out of sheer necessity: the creation of compelling content that provides a value proposition to customers and builds community.

Boom Singapore, a boxing exercise provider, was quick to adapt. It put up live Zoom packages and a subscription to archived classes with a few membership tiers. Sign-up has been made easier with a walkthrough video on Instagram.  These cater to the growing demand for home workouts during the circuit breaker.  Lululemon, a yoga apparel company, similarly shifted towards partnerships with ambassadors and fitness professionals to provide digital classes in yoga, pilates, dance and more – with offerings listed on Eventbrite. These efforts are aimed at churning out sufficiently engaging content, so customers return each day online and see themselves as part of a specific group.  The hope is once circuit breaker fully lifts, these fitness firms would have built robust, loyal relationships that encourage customers to go to their gyms or buy their products.

RESTRUCTURING FOR THE FUTURE

The possibilities are unlimited as seen in these three sectors, each of which have identified new growth opportunities, retooled themselves and reorientated their people to take up new tasks.  There is one commonality across them: Digitalisation that allows them to reach customers instead of expecting them to come to you.

Firms should take draw inspiration from these stories to reimagine, restructure and ready themselves for a post-pandemic future.
