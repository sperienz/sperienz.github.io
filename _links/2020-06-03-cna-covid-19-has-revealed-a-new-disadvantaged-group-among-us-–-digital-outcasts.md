Anthea Ong:

COVID-19 has exposed and deepened the digital divide in our society.Due to the lack of internet connectivity, requisite devices or digital literacy, there are many who are cut-off from such access.  They are not digital natives nor immigrants, they are digital outcasts. Given the speed at which most of society is moving ahead, closing this gnawing digital divide must be an urgent priority if we are to have a Smart Nation that is also united. 

I will address three questions: How deep is the digital divide? What factors contribute to the divide? And what solutions can we consider?

HOW DEEP IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SINGAPORE?

The latest Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 tells us that only 81 per cent of resident households have a personal computer, and only 87 per cent have internet access. This suggests that at least one in 10 households in Singapore are not plugged into our digital world. The bleak picture does not end at infrastructure. Stories from the ground reveal significant struggle in terms of digital literacy and skills, particularly among low-income households, the differently-abled, and seniors.  ReadAble, a community organisation supporting families in rental flat communities, shared the many struggles of parents using laptops donated - whether with Zoom or even in-app functions, resulting in their children’s education being compromised. According to Society Staples, a social enterprise working with the persons with disabilities (PWD) and the Disabled Persons Association, many PWDs have difficulty working from home due to a lack of equipment and Internet access.  Some do not have the skills-set to take their work online especially when their previous work was done face-to-face.  This can mean loss of income and opportunities to retrain or learn new skills.  They also miss out on maintaining or even expanding connections with family and friends, which increases mental stress and strains existing coping mechanisms, especially for those with psycho-social disabilities.

STRUCTURAL ISSUES PERPETUATING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

One of the structural issues that stand out as perpetuating the digital divide is the gaps in government intervention. Market forces are the key driver of this divide. Although internet connectivity and personal computers are necessities in today’s world, they are still priced beyond the reach of the low-income in our society.  This disparity in turn perpetuates further inequality....Community organisation 6th Sense shared that there were families who were too scared to bring those devices home as they would not be able to afford to pay the schools if the devices got lost or broken. Given these gaps, community organisations found that it made more sense to give every family good internet connection and every child a personal computer.

MOVING TOWARDS DIGITAL INCLUSION FOR SGUNITED 

The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) has boldly committed in its Digital Readiness Blueprint that all Singaporeans will be digitally ready, no matter their income or current IT abilities. To realise the Digital Readiness commitment to provide digital connectivity and devices for those with limited resources adequately, a Digital Adequacy Framework should be considered. Because it’s not enough to just be digitally ready or included, this digital participation must adequately support their learning, work and social connections meaningfully. 

Much public policy has been characterised by efficiency, effectiveness and economy, with emphasis on outcome measures that can be determined more by what can be easily measured than by what might be most helpful to measure. Meaningful statistics and metrics across all vulnerable groups should be gathered regularly to inform policy design and updates. 

COVID-19 has spotlighted our deep digital divide and the digital outcasts in our midst. Our clarion call for SGUnited must surely be a Singapore that is digitally resilient and united.
