Crystal Lim-Lange  and Gregor Lim-Lange:

The idealised dream of WFH is looking less like the object of our desire... we are also realising the office had some pretty amazing perks, and WFH comes with a whole host of hidden costs and challenges.  At the same time, now that we have had a taste of the new possibility of flexible work, most of us want the power to choose where and how we work, less so the sole option of WFH permanently.

WORKPLACES CAN BE GOOD FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND COLLABORATION

Research shows being able to go to an office may be good for our mental health and well-being. Being around others provides us with a sense of belonging, connecting and being understood, and directly buffers against the stresses of work and life.  Having a dedicated workplace also allows for clearer boundaries between work space and home space, and can help individuals manage their workloads better and prevent burn-out. A well-designed office space sparks collaboration and drives productivity, which people value. The happenstance element of bumping into people and having random conversations is also a boon for creativity and innovation.

WE WANT DIVERSITY AND CHOICE

Perhaps it’s not about either working in the office or at home but having all options.  In a survey we carried out with more than 170 people across diverse occupations, only 17 per cent said they wanted to work from home primarily. The vast majority wanted the ability to choose.

“People have always wanted diversity and choice in their workplace experience. Even before COVID-19 hit, ‘work’ had left the building and social media had entered, creating a disruption in people’s expectations and a desire for new forms of leadership and social engagement at work,” Tamagin Blake-Smith, principal at Hassell, an architecture, design and urban planning practice told us.

Having a flexible employer open to WFH signifies trust, support and provides agency. Workers may ultimately choose not to use the option to WFH. But when they feel safe, listened to and engaged, they are motivated to work harder.

DOES WORK FROM HOME WORK FOR YOU?

The litmus test whether working from home is suitable for you, is whether it makes you more engaged with your work or less.  There is no one-size-fits all answer. We all have different communication styles and drivers of motivation. WFH is not necessarily a good fit for everyone.

OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE GENUINE ENGAGEMENT

COVID19 has forced companies to rethink the importance of working arrangements and employee welfare. Never before have we seen so many companies introduce measures to prevent burnout and to combat work from home stress.

Our hope is this pandemic provokes companies to take a more human-centric approach towards work, and value employee engagement and well-being as much as profits.  What is clear is that employees want three things – flexibility, the feeling of trust from their employer, and for work to become outcomes-based rather than output-based.
