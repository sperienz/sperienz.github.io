Starbucks announced it will expedite the rollout of its new “Pickup” store concept, powered by mobile ordering, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. It will also expand access to curbside pickup, drive-thru and walk-up counters in less dense, suburban markets, the company said. 

Ahead of the COVID-19 crisis, Starbucks had been testing the Pickup store concept on a small scale. Originally, Starbucks had planned a steady rollout of these Pickup stores across the U.S. in response to what it saw in terms of changing customer behavior. Before COVID-19, for example, Starbucks found that approximately 80% of U.S. transactions in its company-operated stores were for “on-the-go” orders.  In light of that data, Starbucks had been working to better meet these customers’ needs through changes like store remodels that emphasized pickup counters and even new store launches.

The Pickup store concept had also emerged from this reexamination as a way Starbucks could more efficiently serve its customers in major U.S. metros. Like it sounds, Pickup stores specifically cater to customers who order ahead and pay through the Starbucks mobile app. In addition, they cater to customers who place delivery orders through Uber Eats, Starbucks’ delivery partner.

The pandemic has forced Starbucks to speed up its plans with regard to the rollout of its mobile ordering-powered Pickup stores as its traditional cafe business suffered. The company has been impacted by government lockdowns for businesses, shelter-in-place orders, as well as the increased number of companies allowing employees to work from home. Presumably, the latter has led to a reduction in the number of commuters who swing by Starbucks on their way into the office — that’s a metric that may never fully rebound, as work-from-home becomes more commonplace.

Pickup stores won’t solve all these issues, but they will make it more convenient to grab an order while social distancing. But Starbucks’ investment in this pickup format is an indication that mobile ordering with pickup will become a large part of the “new normal.” Its vision is for each large U.S. city to have a mix of both traditional Starbucks cafes and Starbucks Pickup locations that are located within walking distance of one another. This will help to reduce crowding in the cafe locations and aid with social distancing, the company notes, as it shifts more of the “on-the-go” customers to another location. Also in response to COVID-19, Starbucks says it will renovate select store layouts to include a separate pickup counter for mobile orders at high volume stores, making it easier for customers and delivery couriers to grab their orders. In addition, Starbucks says it will increase the number of locations offering curbside pickup, where customers order ahead and pay with the app. 

“Starbucks stores have always been known as the ’third place,’ a welcoming place outside of our home and work where we connect over a cup of coffee,” said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, in a statement. “As we navigate through the COVID-19 crisis, we are accelerating our store transformation plans to address the realities of the current situation, while still providing a safe, familiar and convenient experience for our customers,” he added.
