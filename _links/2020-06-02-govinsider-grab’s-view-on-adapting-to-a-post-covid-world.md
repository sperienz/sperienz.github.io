Lim Yew Heng:

COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way we live and transformed business models and consumer behaviours. Many sectors that have for the longest time stubbornly resisted going digital are now compelled to digitalise to survive. Businesses need to rethink their fundamental business models to improve their product proposition. 

COVID-19 has highlighted how gig work is critical. During lockdowns, people who are not able to commute depend on delivery services to meet their daily needs. With greater emphasis on health and safety, we have seen innovative measures such as contactless deliveries. We also saw a shift in social behavior with customers showing their appreciation for gig work in the form of increased tipping and tip size across the region.

However, this period has also highlighted how gig workers can be vulnerable... Longer-term solutions are needed to ensure the concerns of gig workers are sufficiently addressed. The first step is to better understand their needs because gig workers are not a homogeneous group. We can then work towards practical solutions that address issues such as social protection and access to finance for different types of gig workers. All this while also balancing the needs of consumers and the sustainability of platform businesses. This will require innovation, policy adjustments and close collaboration across the public and private sectors. 

The new normal will need to focus on practical public-private collaborations to serve the greater community as we work towards rebuilding post COVID-19.
