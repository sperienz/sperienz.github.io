*Navigating through an indoor garden, a new exhibition or a themed park will not be the same post-circuit breaker*

The Singapore Government has laid down its roadmap of plans to ease out of the circuit breaker in three phases, with each described as conditional. These are split into Phase 1: Safe Reopening, Phase 2: Safe Transition, and Phase 3: Safe Nation.

Businesses resumed in Phase 1 only make up around 75 percent of the economy. Tourism and entertainment organisations which tend to attract both local and international crowds such as Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, and Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) are not among them. According to the Singapore Tourism Board, “most tourism business activities will be allowed to resume operations in Phase 2, subject to safe management measures, group size and capacity limits being met.”  However, it could take multiple steps and months to reach the third and final phase. Nonetheless, expect controls for crowd sizes, strict safety management measures, and the already emphasised one-metre social distance.

**Expect to be scanned wherever you go** 

As of now, venues are required to use a contact tracing app called SafeEntry that logs in the arrival and departure of people. If there is a confirmed case at that location or venue, contact tracing can be sped up using information from SafeEntry, which in turn prevents new clusters from forming. 

Besides implementing SafeEntry to all locations and venues, businesses in retail, entertainment and leisure are also adjusting their modus operandi prior to welcoming visitors back. The SG Clean accredited organisation and venues are working closely with the authorities on welcoming guests back in a safe manner that is in line with the Government’s health directives including practising good sanitation and hygiene standards while boosting health and safety protocols to ensure a safe working environment for employers and guests when operations resume.

**Providing safe and enjoyable experience** 

With the increased frequency of sanitisation, temperature screening and contact tracing, as well as the decreased capacity of visitors, wandering through an indoor garden, a new exhibition or a themed park will not be the same post-circuit breaker. Expect to be screened, to purchase from an app, and to use contactless technology.

“We are actively reviewing \[our] safety protocols, taking reference from other best industry practices to prepare for the eventual reopening of our enclosed attractions ... Post-Covid-19, the emphasis will be on the use of contactless technology to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for our visitors. We are currently exploring the use of a single app where our visitors can do a variety of activities such as buying time-stamped tickets to our indoor attractions via a cashless system, get real-time updates on areas within the Gardens that are more crowded, as well do their check-in in order to facilitate contact tracing should the need arise.” - Jeanine Tan on behalf of Gardens by the Bay
