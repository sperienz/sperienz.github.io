Melissa Heng:

FairPrice Group and food delivery start-up WhyQ have launched a new food delivery platform which will enable food and beverage (F&B) operators to deliver their food islandwide while charging them zero commission. The digital platform, called Marketplace@WhyQ, launched on Friday (May 29) and is a part of the current WhyQ app platform.

Unlike most delivery platforms, which charge F&B operators a commission of about 30 per cent, Marketplace  @  WhyQ will charge its operators no commission or start up fees. To offset payment gateway and server costs, the platform will include a 6 per cent markup on food prices to be borne by customers.

FairPrice Group chief executive officer Seah Kian Peng said many F&B businesses have been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Eateries here have had to rely on deliveries and takeaway orders due to the circuit breaker restrictions, while coping with steep commission fees from established food delivery platforms. About 100 F&B operators ranging from hawkers to restaurants have registered to be on the platform. Eateries who have signed up to be listed on Marketplace@WhyQ can either tap on WhyQ's third-party delivery services or opt for self-delivery. Any delivery charges will be borne by the customer.

Mr Varun Saraf, co-founder of WhyQ, said the platform aims to encourage as many F&B players to operate delivery-enabled virtual stores. "Marketplace  @  WhyQ is a community platform that enables all food vendors to digitise their offerings with no commission fees, no onboarding charges and a transparent, distance-based delivery fee. It empowers vendors and gives them ownership over discounts and pricing to customers."

F&B operators said they are glad for the option of a more affordable delivery platform.
