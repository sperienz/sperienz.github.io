Rachel Phua:

Many restaurant owners in the central business district had to brace themselves for the new reality that would hit them when Singapore’s "circuit breaker" measures began on Tuesday (Apr 7). Under the measures, there will be no dine-ins at Singapore's 4,800 restaurants and only takeaways and deliveries will be allowed from Tuesday until May 4.

Some restaurants have decided to halt operations...it would be pointless to keep the outlet open as there are too few residents in the CBD to sustain business. Food supplies, staff and rental costs will outweigh whatever they make in deliveries and takeaways. The delivery platforms charge between 28 per cent to 30 per cent commission from his orders... "Taking 30 per cent out of each ticket leaves for very slim profit margins, if we have to rely solely on takeaways." Using islandwide delivery providers like Lalamove and Carpal is not an option either, as each trip could cost between S$10 and S$25, he said. With each customer paying an average of S$19 per transaction, absorbing the delivery charge or passing it on to the customer would not make sense. 

A slew of measures have been announced in Parliament to keep the economy running and jobs intact. A number of them would help prop the F&B industry up, from the 50 per cent wage subsidy - up to 75 per cent for the month of April - and the soon-to-be mandatory property tax rebate. 

According to 2019 estimates from the Singapore Department of Statistics, rentals and remuneration account for more than half of their business cost. Competition on the delivery platforms will also stiffen as an influx of establishments vie for orders. As much as the measures introduced by the Government have provided a lifeline for F&B players, many landlords have yet to say when they will pass down the property tax rebates, causing pressure on many establishments’ cash flow. 

For now, there is little more restaurants can do except to wait for the grants and subsidies to be dispensed, and for the restrictions to lift eventually.
