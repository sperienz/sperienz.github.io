We are living in the midst of unprecedented global crisis, reeling from the outbreak of one of the most infectious diseases that has brought the entire world to a standstill. The circuit breaker demands of social behaviour that is so contrary to what Singaporeans are used to. We have promoted social integration as a panacea to many of our social challenges â€“ race relations, intergenerational gaps, as well as addressing inequality. Thus, the concept of social distancing is a construct that requires re-socialising entrenched norms and behaviours. 

Even after the circuit breaker is lifted and the last infected person is identified and treated, we may not be able to return to the old norm. These are some of the changes:

**FLEXIWORK IS HERE TO STAY**

Now that most of us are working from home, an important barrier is broken. The businesses which are able to survive this pandemic crisis are the ones who were able to shift operations from the office to homes overnight.

**TRANSFORMATION OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS**

This circuit breaker has certainly short-circuited our face-to-face engagements. We may now find it easier to communicate via text, WhatsApp or over Zoom rather than travel out for a real chat over coffee. But we should also note that modes of communication change over time. Though we argue that nothing can replace face-to-face interactions, (any) communication is better than no communication, regardless of the quality of it. "Being socially connected is our brain's lifelong passion," said University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) professor of psychology and biobehavioural science Matthew Liebermann. So as long as we continue to satisfy our desire for socially connection with each other, we are good.

**HUMAN INTERACTIONS ARE STILL IMPORTANT**

Some might argue that this period of forced confinement may release the hidden introvert in some of us. In the busyness of everyday life, we often yearn for that moment of solitude where we can be by ourselves to ponder on our musings. Humans are , by and large, social beings who yield for interaction and the circuit breaker will not change that inert need for external engagement
