Janice Lim:

Disruptive changes have been a constant in Singapore, as in other countries, since Covid-19 first surfaced here on Jan 23. But for some individuals here, Covid-19 has been much more than an inconvenience and a matter of adjustment to their daily routines. It has taken away the lives of their loved ones who were infected, caused mental anguish for those who survived, and robbed many others of their livelihoods.

For these three individuals whose main source of income has been decimated, Covid-19 has also forced them to change their lifestyle and spending habits: They now think twice about buying a cup of coffee from a cafe, or turning on the air-conditioner instead of the fan, for example. 

Although the world they had known for so long had vanished in no time, their can-do spirit came through in the interviews, with some saying that they were thankful for the experience and perspective shift that the pandemic has given them, even though it was not something they had wished for.
