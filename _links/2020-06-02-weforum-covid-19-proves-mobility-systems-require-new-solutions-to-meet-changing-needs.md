COVID-19 has paralyzed mobility systems, with a half of the world’s population in lockdown and changes to public transit services and private offerings changing rapidly. Mobilizing essential workers requires building real-time mobility service information flows.

*This transformation exposed deficiencies across urban and suburban mobility systems that call for substantial changes in allocation of resources, space and costs on commute and deliveries. Perhaps more* 

A new platform launched this week by Wunder Mobility in partnership with the World Economic Forum, Hertz Autovermietung, Allianz Automotive.  It will integrate private, public and joint mobility services into a single search and outreach platform making it easier for essential workers to get to their jobs. Integrated mobility planning tools for users and operators can help systems cope with the current crisis and will be necessary for our future “new mobility normal”.

Transparent real-time information on service availability can easily close some of these gaps. Such information, available to organizations that need to mobilize essential workers, can ensure our mobility systems can be resilient, safe, inclusive, responsive, and sustainable. This is why #WeAllMove, a mobility service match-making platform, was launched this week by Wunder Mobility in partnership with the World Economic Forum COVID Action Platform.
