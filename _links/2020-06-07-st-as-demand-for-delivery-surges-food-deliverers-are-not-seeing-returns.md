While food orders have shot up due to the ban on dining-in under the circuit breaker measures, many delivery riders claim that they have not been reaping the benefits. In fact, 47 out of 58 riders, or 81 per cent, told The New Paper that they are earning less now than before. 

Several of these riders, who work with the three major food delivery platforms here - Deliveroo, Foodpanda and GrabFood - believe they are facing more competition with the influx of new riders during the coronavirus outbreak. "There are more orders, but there are also a lot more riders as more people are getting retrenched due to Covid-19." Some rider  used to earn about $100 a day and the earnings have now dropped to about $20 a day. "Not only do we have to compete with people who got laid off, now we also have to compete with private-hire drivers for orders" 

Like GrabFood, Deliveroo said that discrepancies in earning power of its riders would depend on each individual. But it acknowledged a surge in rider applications, with its spokesman saying: "Deliveroo saw an 80 per cent rise in rider applications since March 16 compared with a normal week... Since March 1, there has been a 50 per cent jump in the number of restaurant sign-ups, compared with the previous month. Our team uses data analytics to match supply and demand, ensuring that we have the right number of riders on the road in the right place at any one time." The platform has welcomed 600 new restaurant-partners since late January and now has a fleet of 6,000 riders. To balance the supply and demand of riders and orders, Deliveroo has rolled out initiatives such as giving riders detailed guides on the best time and places to work.

In the last month, Foodpanda has got on board 200 per cent more of food and beverage partners to offer online deliveries, he said. To help those finding it difficult to get orders, Foodpanda, which rewards its riders per delivery, is allowing them to plan their shift hours a week ahead. However, with more people joining the platform, it is extremely difficult to get shifts now.
