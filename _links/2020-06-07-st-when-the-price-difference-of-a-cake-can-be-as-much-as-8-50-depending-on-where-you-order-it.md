Thanks to the wealth of food delivery apps and websites available, buying food from your favourite hawker stall or restaurant has never been easier.  Yet, the price difference on these apps or websites when ordering the same food from the same shop can vary by as much as $8.50.

Customers can buy Awfully Chocolate cakes on the GrabFood app or directly from the cake shop's website.  GrabFood's delivery fee was $6.50, while Awfully Chocolate charges a flat fee of $15 for deliveries that are made between 10am and 6pm.  The price of the cake is the same on both platforms. GrabFood is able to charge a lower fee by taking a 25 per cent commission from the cake shop.

Some restaurants and hawkers are trying to reach more customers by joining multiple delivery platforms, where the prices of their food can differ markedly. The Sunday Times randomly picked four items from four stalls at Old Airport Road Food Centre that are available on the WhyQ app and Buy4u website.  Three of the four items were cheaper on the WhyQ app.

Buy4u co-founder Alex Ng said that the prices of the food items were higher on his platform because the firm does not take a commission from hawkers, so he marks up the food prices to help cover his costs.  The actual price of the special chicken cutlet from Jack's Kitchen was $3.80, but Buy4u added its own $2 fee.

WhyQ's hawker platform derives revenue from a combination of a delivery fee of $1.50 for each item, paid by the customer, and a cut from the hawkers.  If the hawkers cannot pay a commission, WhyQ marks up the prices to be paid by customers, said chief executive and co-founder Varun Saraf.

Mr Ng, who has a pool of 17 freelance riders and drivers making Buy4u's deliveries, said he pays them between $7 and $12 for each trip, even when he charges a lower delivery fee of $4.50.  Buy4u does not impose a minimum-order fee for some hawker centres, such as Old Airport Road Food Centre, so a customer can order one fried kway teow for $6.50 and still pay a delivery fee of $4.50, even if he lives nearby.  "No choice. Nobody would want to pay a high delivery fee for hawker food. The price of the delivery cannot be more than the food. But the majority of our customers don't order just one item," said Mr Ng. He added that he would need a minimum order of $20 to cover his costs to make a 10 per cent profit from the deal.
