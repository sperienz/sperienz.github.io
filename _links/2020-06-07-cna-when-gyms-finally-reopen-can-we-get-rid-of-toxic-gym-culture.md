Grace Yeoh:

Singapore aims to allow retail, dining-in and fitness facilities to resume business under plans to lift more restrictions in Phase 2. That could come as early as end-June but it’s hard to see how gyms will resume business as usual after the circuit breaker lifts, since customers share the same equipment in small places. 

SAVE GYMS, BUT DITCH GYM CULTURE
Much has been said about how the pandemic has exposed certain structural issues and problems stewing beneath the facade of our pristine national image, from the lack of digital literacy in lower-income households to poor living conditions for migrant workers.
Similarly, on an individual level, the sudden absence of gyms and fitness studios, coupled with the security of distance and the power of 20/20 hindsight, have got me thinking about the more insidious reasons I was previously addicted to religiously patronising them.  

Being away from the gym for several months due to COVID-19 helped me realise the performative aspects of gym culture don’t exist in a vacuum. They’re buttressed by our broader culture of hustle porn and hyperproductivity, where our sense of self-worth is attached to our tangible output. When it comes to physical fitness, this culture of hyperproductivity translates into extreme image consciousness. Unfortunately, when our interests are mainly built on external factors, such as having to show up at a physical gym or rely on the attention and validation of fellow fitness fanatics to feel good, there is little intrinsic motivation to continue once these external factors cease to exist.

A MORE MINDFUL MODEL OF PHYSICAL WELLNESS 

This period of compulsory downtime has stripped us of life’s frills.  When everyone is simply trying to cope with perennial anxiety and fatigue over an uncertain future, prioritising being in tip-top shape suddenly seems trivial in comparison.

We can no longer ignore the bigger conversation that needs to happen about how gym culture affects both physical and mental well-being. Let’s start with dismantling the pernicious culture of fitness, where self-image, identity, and productivity feel so enmeshed, the desire to stay fit became a toxic obsession.
