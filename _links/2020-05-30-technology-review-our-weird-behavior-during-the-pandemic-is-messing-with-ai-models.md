Will Douglas Heaven:

Machine-learning models trained on normal human behavior are finding that normal has changed, and some are no longer working as they should... The pandemic has revealed how intertwined our lives are with AI, exposing a delicate codependence in which changes to our behavior change how AI works, and changes to how AI works change our behavior. This is also a reminder that human involvement in automated systems remains key.

A large streaming firm that has had a sudden influx of content-hungry subscribers is having problems with its recommendation algorithms. The company uses machine learning to suggest relevant and personalized content to viewers so that they keep coming back. But the sudden change in subscriber data was making its system's recommendations less accurate...Many of problems with models arise because more businesses are buying machine-learning systems but lack the in-house know-how needed to maintain them. Retraining a model can require expert human intervention.

If we are looking for a silver lining, then now is a time to take stock of those newly exposed systems and ask how they might be designed better, made more resilient. If machines are to be trusted, we need to watch over them.
