Jessica Vredenburg  and Megan Phillips:

The return to shopping and eating out in some countries may be a welcome relief, but the return to normal retail is a long way off. Some of the routines developed during lockdown and the new economic reality will have a profound impact on retail. 

CHANGED SENSORY EXPERIENCE

As well as the public spacing, tracing and hygiene rules, customers may also notice an absence of certain favourite experiential elements. Atmospherics – such as scent, music, touch, temperature and crowding – all help create an engaging sensory experience for shoppers and patrons to stay and spend. Research suggests customers will stay longer, spend more, feel better and be more satisfied in a retail environment they find pleasing to their senses.  Yet, the new COVID-19 environment may have change shoppers preference into a reassuring freshly cleaned smell.

BE QUIET AND DON’T TOUCH

In New Zealand, tips on how to stay safe under its COVID-19 alert level 2 include restaurants and bars turning down the music volume. Raised voices, it seems, generate a wider “moist breath zone” that may increase viral spread.  Retail guidelines in New Zealand recommend consumers only touch and try on merchandise they intend to buy. In the US, no touch retailing seems increasingly likely. Such measures confound conventional retail theory, which suggests the more consumers touch, sort through, sample and try on, the more they buy. The removal of testers for products such as cosmetics, for example, significantly changes the shopping experience.

STAY BACK

The advice to keep our distance in public can lead to perceived crowding – a psychological state based on the number of individuals in a store, the extent of social interactions and the configuration of merchandise and fixtures.  Higher levels of perceived crowding can lead to less positive emotions and decreased satisfaction.
 Shoppers may simply choose not to enter. If they do, they might feel on edge or even overwhelmed if they are trying to keep a safe distance from others. When personal space is invaded or when personal space zones are relatively large, it can lead to intolerance or even leaving.

Ultimately, if retailers and hospitality service providers want customers to return in greater numbers the goal will be to minimise the perceived risks of infection. Emotionally taxing environments can negatively affect consumer behaviour, so managing the emotional component of the retail or dining experience becomes an even more crucial part of the overall value offered.

Adapting so-called “retail theatre” to include sanitation, hygiene, and keeping consumers calm will create a new kind of psychological comfort for the COVID-19 age.  How readily customers become comfortable with the etiquette of post-pandemic shopping will dictate how effectively retail and hospitality can provide that vital sense of well-being. In time, the words “retail” and “therapy” may again sit comfortably in the same sentence.
