Zhaki Abdullah:

Singapore-based Grab's food delivery business has seen a 60 per cent increase in orders since October and November last year, fuelled in part by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has led to more people working from home and opting for food deliveries. But this increase has not been enough to cover for the losses suffered by the transport side of their business due to the ongoing pandemic.

Grab’s transport business will continue to be impacted in the short to medium term - the business has decreased by a “double digit percentage”.  In the short term, Grab drivers will likely have to pick up passengers as well as do deliveries to earn an income.
