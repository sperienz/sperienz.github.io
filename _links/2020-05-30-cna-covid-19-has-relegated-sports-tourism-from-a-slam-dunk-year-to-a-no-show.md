Gary Bowerman:

Travelling to experience the thrill of live sporting action has witnessed huge growth in the past decade.  According to the World Travel Organization (UNWTO), the global sports tourism industry is worth US$800 million – amounting to about 10 per cent of the global tourism pie. “More and more tourists are interested in sport activities during their trips, whether sports are the main objective of travel or not,” says the World Travel Organization (UNWTO), which organises the World Sports Tourism Congress. It adds that “Sports events can be a catalyst for tourism development if successfully leveraged in terms of destination branding, infrastructure development and other economic and social benefits.” From being a niche sector, sports travel has entered the mainstream.

However, with the Olympics and European Championships 2020 delayed until next year and top matches unable to receive spectators, sports tourism faces a challenging future. Both the sports and tourism industries are palpably aware that rebooting sports-related travel is impossible while public access to matches and events is prohibited.  Much depends on the feared coronavirus second wave, which would likely hit in the later part of the year. Even without a viral resurgence, the travel fear factor is hard to forecast – especially for long-haul trips.
