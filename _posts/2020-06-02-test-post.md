Brand purpose

Brand purpose is brand's reason for being and how the brand is relevant to the world. As Simon Sinek said, "People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it". People don't connect to a company product and services. They buy into the reason why these companies exist; They buy into the idea company exist for something larger than themselves. 

A strong brand purpose means having a distinct brand perspectives that influences what company does and does not do. It's what drives company forward. Brand purpose offers a basis for customer relationships that goes beyond functional benefits - to self expressive, emotional or social benefits.

A purpose led brand with clear values create employee and customer happiness, the 2 biggest drivers of growth.
