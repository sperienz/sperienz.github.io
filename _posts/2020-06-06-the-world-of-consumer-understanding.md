We have entered new age in marketing where brand and consumer relationships have evolved from what they used to be - to become actual relationship. To unlock growth opportunities in this new age of brand and consumer relationship, we must keep pace by developing a deep understanding and empathy of people's lives. To demystify the complex world of consumer, we need to:

* Place ourselves in the lives of our consumer and demonstrate empathy. 
* Use consumer understanding and data to define segments, 
* Apply our understanding of consumer segment to develop differentiated strategies and tailored experiences. 
* Synthesize multiple sources of information across the consumer journey to generate actionable insights, 
* connect the data dots to uncover opportunities, barriers and drive business decisions 

With consumers become increasingly digital savvy and shifting expectation, it is essential to entrench culture of consumer centricity to build enduring connection with consumers and win their hearts and minds. 

Unlocking growth through developing deep understanding of people lives.

Consumer centricity is about putting our consumers at the heart of everything we do so we can work together as an organisation to design and deliver experiences that appeal to them most. It is about understanding our consumer segment, getting under their skin and finding the underlying reasons that compel them to act.

Key to become consumer centric:

* visible consumer focused leadership
* understand your consumer
* design consumer experiences
* set metrics that matter
* feedback drives continous improvement

To deliver consumer centric experiences, we must begin with empathy. Empathy enables us to not only experience and understand another person's circumstances, but it also puts us in our consumers' shoes to experience what they are feeling. Consumer centricity requires us to focus on the needs of our most valuable consumers. We identify most valuable consumers through segmentation. Segmentation is not just demographics but also based on behaviors, attitudes, and underlying motivations. The benefits of segmentation are:

* identifies where to focus resources and efforts for maximum returns
* informs marketing strategies and activities
* helps us better understand our consumer at a granular level
* provides an anchor to develop marketing activities that respond to consumer needs and trends accordingly

In defining the consumer segments, we need to ask 3 key questions:

1. Whom we are already attracting? We need to analyse past performance to determine type of consumers and deliver higher yield than the rest
2. What are the growth segment? We need to layer secondary research on growth trends to identity segments with greatest future growth potential
3. Which segment do we have a right to win in? We need to evaluate potential consumer segments to establish if we can meet their needs.

After defining consumer segments, we then need to find ways to grow them. One critical way to unlock growth is through actionable insights. Insights is an "Aha!" moment that have profound implications - a penetrating discovery about consumer motivations that can be applied to unlock growth. This insights come when:

* we combine bits of data around a subject
* we include seemingly irrelevant data and suddenly see the significance
* we make connections or see a pattern that was not previously apparent

However, people often confuse information (what the consumer said or did) with insights (why the consumer said or did).  Here, information is defined as a statement or fact; often comes straight from research report or debrief; is something you or someone else observed/heard; with no or little interpretation. Meanwhile insight is expressed as want, need, belief or feeling; is an accurate representation of the consumer's reality, offer a fresh perspective, even if obvious once found out; opens up opportunities
