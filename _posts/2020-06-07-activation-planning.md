In a world where people are exposed to almost 10K messages per day across multiple channel, we have to break through the clutter using well-planned and well-executed activation to connect with our consumers.  

Before we look at execution / how to conduct activation symphony with brilliance and solid outcomes, we must define the "why", "what" and "where". Our goal is to create impactful BIG communication ideas that drive engagement with consumers and inspire meaningful brand interactions; translate into a fully integrated campaign plan across relevant touchpoints, evaluate ideas and creative applications rigorously, formulate clear strategies to reach out to the right consumer segments with the right message, via the right channel at the right moment. At the same time, we need to consider how to allocate media spending to touchpoints in a fashion optimal for achieving intended outcomes, identify the right partners, learn how to best work with them and leverage their experience and assets to achieve business and communications objectives.

Activation Planning is where we identify the "why", "what" and "where" to develop meaningful consumer experiences. Activation can help increase brand awareness and cut through the brand clutter. Activation is an important part of marketing mix. Great activation goes beyond tactical promotions. 

Creating a good brief

At the heart of great activation is of course great idea - but you can't have great work without a great brief to provide agency partners with clear direction and inspirations to deliver outstanding activation. The journey start with a brief - so it is fundamental to get it right. A good brief with clear direction does not mean telling the agency exactly what to do. Instead, it is about inspiring them to deliver against your objectives. The purpose of the brief is to both inform and inspire. It should capture relevant provocative points such as brand issues and insights to inspire powerful and creative thinking and communication. Agencies are problem solving companies, nothing inspire them more than juicy problem. 

"Give me the freedom of tight brief" - David Ogilvy

A good brief should include these components:

* the brief in one sentence: succint summary, single minded reason for briefing
* the problem we are trying to resolve: One key problem - not multiple issues 
* what do we need to do: key things we hope to achieve through this initiative (in term of business, marketing, communication objective)
* who are we talking to: which segment / tribes?
* what key challenges do we face: what preventing us from currently tackling this problem
* what do we want people to think & do: what will drive behavior and attitude change.
* Other advise: get an aligned point of view, make hard choices,  bring the brief to life with compelling consumer insight, storytelling and inspiring visuals. Ensure it's clear!

A good briefing gets the work off to a great start. How do we deliver a great brief?

* clarify the problem
* keep it simple
* consumer is at the heart
* make hard choices
* brief to inspire

Tips to run the brief:

* choose the right place, make it somewhere inspiring and relevant to either your brand or target audience
* invite the right people: not too many or too few
* set the right behaviours: encourage collaboration, building upon ideas of others and consider feedback
* bring the consumer segment to life to ensure clear understanding of target segments
* deliver with passion and energise members
* discuss the tangibles of the brief
